# AUTO GAMMA CORRECTION

What is Gamma Correction?
<br />
Gamma is an important but seldom understood characteristic of virtually all digital imaging systems. It defines the relationship between a pixel's numerical value and its actual luminance. Without gamma, shades captured by digital cameras wouldn't appear as they did to our eyes (on a standard monitor). It's also referred to as gamma correction, gamma encoding or gamma compression, but these all refer to a similar concept. Understanding how gamma works can improve one's exposure technique, in addition to helping one make the most of image editing.

What we done?<br />
In this work we created python function to do adaptive gamma correction in Input Image. This is done by using the jounel
